            <h2>Why LA?</h2>
            <p>
              Los Angeles is a trend-setting global metropolis with a
              fascinating history and a rich cultural heritage. LA's cultural
              attractions are second to none, whether it’s the Space Shuttle
              Endeavour, Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Getty Center or art
              galleries and urban art. From Transformers: The Ride-3D to
              legendary studios, thriving nightlife and renowned theatre
              productions, LA is truly the entertainment capital of the world.
              LA dining is acclaimed for Michelin-starred restaurants and
              multicultural neighborhoods alike. Sports fans know that LA is the
              city of champions, while active Angelenos can explore 75 miles of
              coastline and hundreds of miles of bike and hiking trails. Shop
              for everything from couture to vintage, or relax in one of LA’s
              world class spas. It's no wonder Los Angeles is a top choice for
              people from all over the world when deciding where to travel. From
              parks to beaches, museums to tours of Hollywood and much more,
              there are always things to do in the Los Angeles area.

                are the largest new and used bookstore in California. Plus,
                we're the only one that's 22,000 sq. feet with a record store,
                comic book store, 5 art studios, an epic yarn shop, a famous
                book tunnel, a mammoth head, and unexpected nooks of funkiness.
                Also we are in a hundred-year-old bank building, so we have
                vaults and ghosts."
